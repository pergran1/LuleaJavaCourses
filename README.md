# Lule√• Java courses

This is a repository where I store some of the labs and exercises from two Java courses taken at the Lule√• University üè´.

The first course is: [Introduction in programming with Java](https://www.ltu.se/edu/course/D00/D0017D/D0017D-Inledande-programmering-i-Java-1.67717) 

And the second course is: [Object oriented programming in Java](https://www.ltu.se/edu/course/D00/D0018D/D0018D-Objektorienterad-programmering-i-Java-1.67720)

Here I only use Java but I did the same thing but with Scala instead in this repository: [Scala](https://github.com/pergran1/LuleaJavaCourseswithScala)
